                                        The main way people get hacked is by leaving important accounts on public devices like a library computer and forgetting to log off. You may also let google save the passwords, and people can login to your account after you have left. If you don't want that to happen, then you should follow these tips.

                                    <p>
                                        You should get an Anti-Virus and a Firewall software so then it would be harder for hackers to hack your computer, it may be a small change and a hassle for some, but trust me it is worth it because it will be a guard for you and make it even harder for the hackers to get to your private personal information.

                                    <p>So if you use the same password for multiple websites it will be easier to hack you since it's just one password they memorize and if you have the same password for a password manager it will be even easier to hack you since they know all of your passwords and every site they're used on so if you want to avoid getting hacked change your password. <br><br><br>Do you think that your password is secure?

                                <p>It is important that you don't post everything online because people from across the globe can see what you posted. I'm not saying that you shouldn't post anything online, I am just saying don't post really personal things online as public, at least put it on private so only friends or family can see. You could leak personal information that hackers could use to impersonate you and even know your bank account or even location and other necessities. Well, do you think you are secure? Check out this quiz and see if your personal data is secure.</p><br>
